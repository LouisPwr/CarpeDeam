General:
- Damage correction
- 1. round of assembly with reads only --> likelihood model
- 2. round of assembly with contigs only --> default extension rule
- NO PROTEIN ASSEMBLY
- Allow contig-contig extension only once


Special parameters:
--ext-random-align          : likelihood for calculating random alignment; affects threshold of rejecting a candidate extension based on the alignment likelihood
--min-ryseq-id				: RY-space sequence identity which only applies in default extension but secures that extensions have at least this ry-seq-identity
--correction-min-ry-seqid	: Uses only reads that align with at least X% ry-seq-identity to avoid spurious alignments to be included in the correction porcess
--clust-min-ry-seq-id 		: Enables a stricter clustering to ensure at least X% ry-seq-identity in the cluster process 
--clust-rymer-len			: Should improve the clustering process by using longer ry-mer length in the kmermatcher process since after assembly longer ry-mers can easily be used
